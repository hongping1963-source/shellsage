## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style Guide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow the [TypeScript coding guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines)
* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use single quotes for strings
* Use PascalCase for class names
* Use camelCase for function names
* Use UPPER_CASE for constants
* Add type annotations for function parameters and return types
* Use async/await over raw promises
* Use early returns to reduce nesting
* Keep functions small and focused
* Write self-documenting code
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Quality

* Write unit tests for new code
* Maintain at least 80% code coverage
* Use ESLint and Prettier
* Follow SOLID principles
* Write defensive code
* Handle errors appropriately
* Add logging for important operations
* Optimize performance where necessary

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

#### Type
Must be one of the following:
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying the place of the commit change, such as:
* config
* terminal
* command
* error
* etc.

#### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Git Workflow

1. Keep your branch up to date
2. Rebase your branch before merging
3. Squash commits if necessary
4. Write meaningful commit messages
5. Reference issues in commits when applicable
