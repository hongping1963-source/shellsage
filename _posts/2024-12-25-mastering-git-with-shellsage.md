> git checkout -b feature/new-feature    # Create new branch
> git status                            # Check changes
> git add .                            # Stage changes
> git commit -m "feat: add new feature" # Commit with conventional message
```

## Preventing Common Git Mistakes

### 1. Force Push Protection
```bash
$ git push -f
> Warning: Force push detected. This will overwrite remote changes.
> Suggestion: Use --force-with-lease instead for safer force pushes
```

### 2. Large File Detection
```bash
$ git add large-file.zip
> Warning: Large file detected (150MB)
> Suggestion: Consider using Git LFS for large files
```

### 3. Branch Protection
```bash
$ git branch -D main
> Warning: Attempting to delete protected branch
> Suggestion: Protected branches should not be deleted
```

## Advanced Git Operations

ShellSage makes complex Git operations more accessible:

### 1. Interactive Rebase
```bash
$ git rebase -i
> Suggestions:
> pick - keep commit
> squash - combine with previous
> drop - remove commit
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution
```bash
$ git merge feature-branch
> Conflict detected in:
> - src/main.ts
> - package.json
> Suggestion: Use VS Code's merge editor
```

## Git Best Practices with ShellSage

### 1. Conventional Commits
ShellSage helps maintain consistent commit messages:

```bash
$ git commit -m
> Suggested formats:
> feat: add new feature
> fix: resolve bug
> docs: update documentation
> style: improve formatting
```

### 2. Branch Management
```bash
$ git checkout
> Suggested branches:
> feature/user-auth     # Current feature
> fix/issue-123        # Bug fix
> release/v1.0.0      # Release branch
```

## Time-Saving Git Aliases

ShellSage can suggest and manage Git aliases:

```bash
# Common aliases
$ git config --global alias.
> co = checkout
> br = branch
> ci = commit
> st = status
```

## Advanced Git Workflows

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow
```bash
# Start new feature
$ git flow feature start
> git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop
> git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Complete feature
$ git flow feature finish
> git checkout develop
> git merge --no-ff feature/new-feature
> git push origin develop
```

### 2. Release Management
```bash
# Create release
$ git flow release start
> git checkout -b release/v1.0.0 develop
> npm version 1.0.0
> git push origin release/v1.0.0
```

## Git Analytics and Insights

> Suggestions based on team conventions:
> feature/USER-123-description
> feature/add-new-component
```

### 2. Code Review Process
